abstract = {We assessed the influence of terrain variables on the occupancy of the little red brocket deer (Mazama rufina) in the Central Andes of Colombia. Occupancy increased with elevation up to 3000, where it starts decreasing. This information is crucial to predict the potential effects of climate change on M. rufina and other mountain species.},

	abstract = {Mazama temama (Kerr, 1792) is a representative species of the northern Neotropics, but the geographic range limits for this species remain unclear. We report the southernmost record of M. temama from the southwestern Colombian Andes, increasing the previously known range of this species by more than 300 km. We obtained a cytochrome gene sequence (849 bp) which is 95% identical to samples from Mexico. This record raises the need for extensive sampling to obtain more complete information about the distribution of M. temama in northern Colombia.},
